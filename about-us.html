        St Teresa of Avila also called St Teresa of Jesus was born at Avila, Spain on 28 March 1515 in a very noble
        family of knights. As she grew up as a teenager
        in the boarding school of Augustinian nuns, she had the inspiration to follow the religious life. Overcoming all
        the objections from her family and friends,
        she entered the Carmel Convent in 1536. She is known for her teaching and writing. Her main works are
        Autobiography, Way of Perfection, Interior Castle etc.
        She is remembered as a woman of iron. With her daringness and profound spirit of true love she established 17
        convents and 15 monasteries within just 21 years.
        She was truly a person of prayer and breathed her last in 1582. Forty years after her death in the year 1622 she
        was canonized and on 27 September 1970
        she was named a Doctor of the Church by Pope Paul VI.

        13 February 1866: Rev Mother Eliswa from Verapoly, Kerala, India, founded the religious institute, the
        Congregation of Teresian Carmelite (CTC).
        <br>
        Rev Mother Eliswa, born on 15 October 1831, was the eldest of eight siblings from the wealthy and religious
        Vypassery Family of Ochanthuruth.
        She was the first nun from Kerala to establish the first convent in the state. The Congregation, under her, was
        given the task of teaching girls
        who had no means to pursue education. Her mission in life was to educate young girls and she set up St Joseph
        School for them at Varapuzha.
        Mother Eliswa always meant what she said and did. She was purely motherly especially to the poor. She was a
        trend setter and she responded whole
        heartedly to the challenges of her liberative mission. Her daughters follow her mission facing the challenges of
        times. She breathed her last on
        18 July 1913 at the Convent near Varapuzha School.
